          <h4>Why Do I Study Computer Science?</h4>
          <p>As much as it falls under Science, it is art. I study computer science because I dream of becoming a master of this ever changing concept, and to create things with this virtually limitless tool.</p>

      <h2>Video Games and The Ever Changing Industry</h2>
      <p>My ultimate, and achievable goal is to be a valuable asset in many ways in the gaming industry. I have played video games since I was a child, and hold a deep passion for games, that in my eyes are stimulating, intricate artwork. To be able to create such a thing, and be apart of that process would mean the world to me. To be a known and respected name in gaming would be incredible.</p>

      <h2>The Importance of Goal Setting</h2>
      <p>Goal setting is something that changed my life. In the vast sandox that life is, I realized we are truly designed to choose our own purpose here, and navigate the time spent in a mindful and deliberate way.</p>

      <h2>Hello, World!</h2>
      <p>I aspire to reach a point in my life where I can wake up everday as if it were my first day on earth. As I age and reach huge milestones, I hold in the back of my mind that regardless of the situation, I can hold onto the things that I chose that matters, and transcend constructs. Computers, technology, and creation is what makes me feel most like me.</p>
